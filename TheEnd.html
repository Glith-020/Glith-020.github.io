            <h1>The End</h1>
            All good things come to an end. So much work, so much things i did. It does matter, but it wasnt enough for people?
            They reported me as a bad leader. They disliked my methods. So here came the punishment. I am no longer the Head Researcher.
            I am dissapointed in myself, but worst of all- I dissapointed Richard, he believed I could do good with it, looks like I failed.
	    I could have done better.
