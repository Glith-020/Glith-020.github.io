            <h1>The Prolouge</h1>
            The day when my fate has changed. The day when I let my past go.
            My Enclave and I fought against dutchclave. We did a good job. And the old Vice President of the Richclave saw this.
            He saw Potential. We made a deal, i combine my enclave into theirs and they give us high ranks. I became the Colonel.
            But His plan didn't go as planned. All my old members went offline. Only Kote and Joshyy got transfered.
            A bit later, Joshyy left and went to BoS. And much later, Kote retired.
